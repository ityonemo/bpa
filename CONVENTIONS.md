# bpa proof-writing conventions

These conventions optimize for the two audiences of a `.bpa` file: an LLM
writing it and a human reviewing it. Most are style (normalized by the planned
`bpa fmt`); a few are checker-enforced where noted. `examples/pa.bpa` is the
living exemplar.

## File layout

Order: header comment → imports → aliases → sorts → constants → functions →
predicates → axioms → theorems. Separate the groups with blank lines; in
larger files, use section comments (`// -- axioms ----`).

A **parenthesized parameter list makes a statement schematic** (a comptime
form, instantiated per concrete argument): `axiom induction(prop: Nat -> Prop):
...` is an assumption family; `theorem contrapositive(p: Prop, q: Prop): ...
proof ... qed` is a proven family whose proof is re-checked at every
instantiation. The keyword carries the epistemic status either way — an axiom
never has a proof, a theorem always does. Libraries exporting schematic
theorems should ship a smoke file instantiating each one (schemas are never
checked at declaration, only at use).

The header comment states what the file is and what it proves.

## The forward manifest

An optional block of `forward <name>` lines after the axioms declares, up
front, which theorems the file will prove — a table of contents the checker
verifies (each name must be defined in this file as a theorem, plain or
schematic; nothing else is checked).  This exists for organizational purposes,
because theorem bodies can get quite large, and can signal that a particular
theorem is expected to be imported, however, note that this is not a promise.

```
// -- forwarded theorems ----
forward addZeroRight
forward addIsCommutative
```

## Comments carry the "why"

These comments are not required, they are just a helpful guide for humans
and LLMs to understand the context of what is followed.  Expect an LLM to
be able to be prompted with a preceding comment block and be able to scan
the theorem to assess if it's correct.

- Every theorem is preceded by a **strategy comment**: the proof idea in one or
  two lines (e.g. `// Strategy: induction on b with prop(k) := forall a. ...`).
  A reviewer — or a future session with a cold context — should never have to
  reverse-engineer intent from the steps.
- Inside proofs, **phase comments** mark the structure: `// base case: ...`,
  `// inductive step: ...`.
- Comments explain *why*; steps state *what*. Don't paraphrase a step in its
  comment.
- Statement-level quirks get a comment (e.g. why a quantifier order was chosen).

## Naming

Every category has a distinct look:

| Category                | Style           | Example                        |
|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Sorts                   | ProudCamelCase  | `Nat`, `Prop`, `Word32`        |
| Constants               | ALLCAPS         | `ZERO`, `ONE`                  |
| Functions / predicates  | snake_case word | `succ`, `add`, `even`          |
| Axioms/theorems         | camelCase       | `addZeroLeft`, `induction`     |
| Labels                  | kebab-case      | `induction-step`, `given-inductive-hypothesis`   |
| Variables               | snake_case      | `a`, `k`, `high_word`          |

- Functions and predicates should not be **one letter**: `succ` not `S`. The same
  applies to schema parameters (`prop: Nat -> Prop`, not `P`) — they are
  function-shaped.
- Statement names are **spelled out**: `addZeroLeft`, not `addZ`; properties in
  full: `addIsCommutative`, not `addComm`.
  - Equation-shaped facts encode which argument position they describe:
    axiom `addZeroLeft` is `add(ZERO, b) = b`; theorem `addZeroRight` is
    `add(n, ZERO) = n`; likewise `addSuccLeft` / `addSuccRight`. This prevents
    near-collisions between an axiom and its mirror-image theorem.
- Kebab labels work because `-` joins identifier characters (`x->y` still
  lexes as an arrow). A deliberate consequence: there is **no infix minus,
  ever** — subtraction is `sub(a, b)`.  Note that this convention may be
  changed in the future.
- Variables may be one letter, but this is slightly discouraged — reserve it
  for conventional mathematical scalars in their home domain: `a, b, m, n`
  ranging over `Nat`; `x, y, z, w` over the reals; `i, j, k` as indices
  (including induction variables). Anything else gets a snake_case word.
- **Element-domain sorts — prefer `Element`.** When a theory is built over an
  ambient domain of *underlying individuals* it quantifies over — sets over their
  members, functions over their points, relations over their relata — name that
  element-domain sort **`Element`** (as `std/element.bpa` does). Reserve it for the
  underlying individuals, NOT the structure's own carrier: a group is `Grp`, ℤ is
  `Int`, a set is `Set` — those *are* the objects the theory is about, not a domain
  beneath them. A shared canonical name lets element-domains compose (and `model`
  onto each other) without an aliasing layer. This is a *recommendation*: the older
  `set.bpa`/`function.bpa` spell the same concept `Universe` and are reconciled to
  `element.Element` by alias — a working split, not a bug; **do not retrofit them**.
  The guideline is for new theories, where the name is free.

## Binder order — canonical, first-appearance (lint-enforced)

A statement's leading `forall` block binds its variables in **first-appearance
order**: the order they first occur, left to right, in the body. `add` is
associative as `forall a, b, c: Nat; add(add(a, b), c) = add(a, add(b, c))` —
`a`, then `b`, then `c` as you read the left-hand side — **never** `forall c, b,
a` even if the proof fixes them in that order.

The rule exists because a statement's signature is a property of *what it says*,
not *how it is proved*. Two logically identical facts whose binders are permuted
are NOT alpha-equal, so a proof-convenience ordering silently breaks any
mechanism that matches on syntactic shape — most sharply `model`, whose axiom
discharge needs a local fact to alpha-match the (remapped) abstract axiom. Keep
every statement canonical and a local fact discharges the abstract axiom
directly, with no binder-reordering adapter theorem in between.

`bpa lint <file>` flags every violation (`'forall c, b, a' should be 'forall a,
b, c'`). Run it on new `.bpa`; it also reads `.md` (only source-agnostic rules
like this one apply to a literate transliteration — its naming mirrors the book).

## Labels

**The dump test.** The label column IS the proof outline: stripping every
assertion and justification line must leave a skeleton from which a reader can
reconstruct the argument. Every label is judged by what it contributes to that
skeleton.

- **Every label is a mini-assertion of the fact it establishes**:
  `@six-is-nonzero`, `@three-is-below-six`, `@quotients-are-equal`. Never bare
  counters (`eq2`, `s3`), never abbreviations (`gen-a`, `mi-b`, `qcbl` — write
  the words out), never pure operation names when a content name exists.
- **A specialized fact folds its instance into the name**:
  `@remainder-is-unique-nine-six`. Long names are fine — noise is
  meaninglessness, not length.
- **Provenance is not content.** The justification line already says
  `[by theorem modIntro]`; the label says what the step *asserts*
  (`@remainder-is-unique`), not what was cited. Exception that proves the
  rule: when a lemma's own name is already an assertion
  (`addIsCommutative`), its kebab form is a fine content name
  (`@add-is-commutative`).
- **Name the move, not the proposition.** The formula line is right there — a
  label that just re-narrates its syntax earns nothing. On a line reading
  `forall b, d: Nat; ...`, `@for-all-b-d` is dead weight; the step's real
  contribution is *discharging the `fix`* (`@discharge-b`). Likewise a
  `forall_elim` step's content is the *specialization* it performs
  (`@specialized-to-this-a-b`), not that the result is now quantifier-free.
  Ask "what did this step DO to the argument?" — that is the name.
- **Steps that assert nothing should not exist.** Specialization towers
  collapse with multi-argument `forall_elim(A, B, C)`; modus-ponens discharge
  ladders collapse with `tautology` (see the apply-a-lemma idiom below). Only
  name what survives.

**Stock names for structural roles** (one standard spelling per role, full
words — the role IS the content for these):

| role | name |
|---|---|
| final step of every proof | `@conclusion` |
| step establishing `P(ZERO)` (the base premise) | `@base-case` |
| block proving the base when it needs its own subproof | `@base-case-proof` (its export step is then `@base-case`) |
| fix-block deriving the successor case | `@induction-step` |
| assume-block introducing `P(k)` | `@given-inductive-hypothesis` |
| restatement of `P(k)` inside it | `@inductive-hypothesis` |
| the implication at fixed `k` | `@induction-step-at-k` |
| the generalized step premise | `@induction-step-for-all-k` |
| fix-block generalizing a statement binder | `@generalize-<var>` |
| forall_intro closing such a block | `@discharge-<var>` (it discharges the `fix`; do NOT name it `@for-all-<var>`, which merely echoes the formula) |
| forall_elim specializing a lemma | `@specialized-<to-what>` / `@<fact>-at-<args>` (name the specialization, not that it is now quantifier-free) |
| assume-block (hypothesis intro) | `@given-<content>` (`@given-b-nonzero`) |
| implies_intro export | `@<cond>-implies-<result>` |
| the existential feeding an unpack | `@<thing>-exists` (`@gap-exists`) |
| unpack-block naming a witness | `@with-<role>-<var>` (`@with-gap-d`, `@with-quotient-j`); fallback `@with-witness-<var>` |
| case arms (`case`/`or_elim` branches) | `@when-<condition>` (`@when-zero`, `@when-successor`) |
| a flipped equation (`[by symmetry x]`) | `@<content>-flipped` |

The induction payoff line reads
`[by instantiate induction((fun ...)) base-case induction-step-for-all-k]`.

**The apply-a-lemma idiom** — cite, specialize, discharge; three nameable
steps, no filler:

  ```
  @remainder-is-unique |
    forall a, b, q, r: Nat; b != ZERO -> less_than(r, b) -> add(mul(b, q), r) = a -> mod(a, b) = r
    [by theorem modIntro]
  @remainder-is-determined-nine-six |
    SIX != ZERO -> less_than(THREE, SIX) -> add(mul(SIX, ONE), THREE) = NINE -> mod(NINE, SIX) = THREE
    [by forall_elim(NINE, SIX, ONE, THREE) remainder-is-unique]
  @conclusion |
    mod(NINE, SIX) = THREE
    [by tautology remainder-is-determined-nine-six six-is-nonzero three-is-below-six sum-is-nine]
  ```

  (`tautology` replays as a kernel-checked certificate here — a Horn-shaped discharge
  never approaches its atom cap or step budget. If a discharge ever exceeds
  the 16-atom cap, fall back to named `modus_ponens` steps.)

## Proof variables

- **No shadowing — checker-enforced.** No introduced name (quantifier binder,
  lambda binder, parameter, fix/unpack variable) may reuse any visible name: a
  variable in scope, a schema parameter, or any declared symbol.
- When generalizing a statement variable with `fix`, reuse the statement's own
  binder name (`theorem t: forall b, ... proof @g | fix b: Nat { ... }`). Binder
  hints and fix-variables don't collide — hints carry no identity.
- Induction variables are named `k` (matching the schema's conventional
  parameter).
- Variable names must be fresh per proof (checker-enforced). When a conceptual
  variable must be re-fixed in a disjoint subproof, append an index: `a`, then
  `a2`, `a3`.
- When restating a fact whose binder names would shadow variables in scope,
  rename the binders freely (`forall c: Nat; ...`) — alpha-equivalence ignores
  hints.

## Imports

- `import peano <<< "peano.bpa"` binds a namespace to a file (path relative to
  the importing file). Imports come first in the file.
- Everything imported is referenced **qualified** (`peano.Nat`,
  `[by theorem peano.addIsCommutative]`) or via an **explicit alias**:
  `sort Nat = peano.Nat`, `const ZERO = peano.ZERO`, `func succ = peano.succ`.
  Aliases are kind-checked views of the same entity — both spellings denote
  the same thing, and there is no wildcard `open`.
- **Alias only when it earns its place: alias a name used more than once,
  qualify inline (`peano.mulSuccLeft`) for a single use.** An alias line at
  the top pays for itself when the name recurs; for a lone reference it just
  adds a line to scan past, so write the qualified name at its one call site
  instead. (This keeps alias headers to the vocabulary a file actually
  leans on.)
- **Naming the arithmetic theory**: `by arithmetic` resolves its vocabulary
  and certificate lemmas in **local scope**; `by arithmetic(<module>)`
  resolves them against an imported theory module (e.g.
  `by arithmetic(ordering)` after `import ordering <<< "std/peano-ordering.bpa"`).
  Prefer the named form in a file that is layers above the primitives or is a
  subdomain still building its own vocabulary: it certifies against the solid
  theory beneath it without aliasing `add`/`less_than`/the order lemmas into
  the local namespace. `std/peano-ordering.bpa` is the canonical theory module
  (it carries the full order + Farkas lemma set). A named theory must supply
  every symbol the goal uses, or the check hard-errors naming the gap.
- **Trust model**: `bpa check` verifies everything by default — arithmetic
  must certify, imported proofs are re-checked, schemas re-instantiate. The
  speed flags defer layers for iteration (`--fast` accepts arithmetic
  accelerated verdicts; `--faster` also trusts imported proofs, reporting them
  as trusted; `--reckless` also trusts imported schemas), always with a loud
  accelerated banner. Re-run plain `bpa check` before finalizing.

## Layout of steps

- Each step is three lines: the `@`-sigiled label alone, then the formula, then
  the bracketed justification — the formula and justification aligned two spaces
  under the label:

  ```
  @conclusion |
    forall n: Nat; add(n, ZERO) = n
    [by instantiate induction((fun k: Nat => add(k, ZERO) = k)) base step]
  ```

  The `@` marks a definition and sits at the left margin, so labels form a
  scannable gutter column; citations of a label stay bare. (The brackets are
  syntax — the justification is a delimited unit — but the line breaks are
  convention; the checker is whitespace-insensitive. `bpa fmt` produces this
  shape.)
- Two-space indent per block depth.
- Blank line between proof phases; none within a phase.
- Soft limit ~100 columns.
- Layout tokens are not "overhead": structure gives both the reviewer and a
  generating LLM room to think. Do not compress for token frugality.
- `bpa fmt <file>` normalizes all of this mechanically (in place;
  `--check` reports instead of rewriting). It is strictly a whitespace and
  indentation tool: it preserves comments, blank-line placement (collapsed to
  one), and the author's line breaks within statements (re-indenting
  continuations to +2) — and it never checks or rewrites names.
